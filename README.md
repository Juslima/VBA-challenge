This project involves using VBA scripting in Microsoft Excel to analyze a set of stock market data. The data includes information such as the ticker symbol, date, opening price, closing price, high and low prices, and total stock volume for each stock over a given period.

The first step in the project is to write a VBA script that loops through each row of the data and calculates the yearly change in price and the percentage change in price for each stock. The yearly change is calculated by subtracting the opening price at the beginning of the year from the closing price at the end of the year. The percentage change is then calculated as the yearly change divided by the opening price, multiplied by 100.

The script also calculates the total stock volume for each stock over the given period.

Once these calculations are complete, the script outputs the results to a new worksheet in the same Excel file. The output includes the ticker symbol, yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock.

In addition to the basic calculations, the script also includes functionality to identify the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume over the given period. This is accomplished by looping through the data again and keeping track of the highest and lowest percentage changes and total volumes, as well as the corresponding ticker symbols.

Finally, the script outputs the results of these calculations to the same worksheet, along with the corresponding ticker symbols. This allows the user to quickly identify the stocks with the greatest changes and volumes over the given period.

Overall, this project provides a useful tool for analyzing stock market data and identifying trends and outliers. By using VBA scripting in Excel, it is possible to automate the process of analyzing large sets of data and generating useful insights.
